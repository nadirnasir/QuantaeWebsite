							<p><strong>Company Overview.</strong>
&nbsp;Quantae is developing the industry's most powerful adaptive
foreign language learning technology solution; initial release will be
for Spanish and Arabic language, followed by French and German. 
Our solution fits in the fast-growing language
learning market to bring ease and effectiveness to an unprecedented
level. Unlike a traditional classroom that presents the same material
to every student, our adaptive learning engine continuously adapts to
an individual's unique learning needs. This enables dynamic changes to
the learning workflow to maximize language absorption.&nbsp;<a href="learn_more.html">Learn More...</a></p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Strength through Team.</span>
&nbsp;Quantae was founded by a group of three close friends who came
together with their rich technical experience as well as domain
knowledge necessary to bring to the world the revolutionary concept of
adaptive learning technology within the foreign language learning
paradigm.<br /><br /><br />
